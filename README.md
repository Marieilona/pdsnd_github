## Bikeshare data
This project is a part of the Udacity Nanodegree [Programming For Data Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104)

### Description
This program let users analyze data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington in the US. The user can choose what city they want to analyze and decide what month and day that should be analyzed. It is possible to chose all months and days. Based on the users input the following data is calculated and displayed:

**Time stats**
  - Most common month
  - Most common weekday
  - Most common start hour

**Station stats**
  - Most common start station
  - Most common end station
  - Most common route

**Time duration stats**
  - Total travel time
  - Average travel time

**User stats**
  - Count of user types
  - Count of gender

### Files in the repository
*Bikeshare_2.py* is a python script which runs the whole program. 

The bikeshare data have been provided by Udacity in three csv-files for each city named *chicago.csv*, *new_york_city.csv* and *washington.csv*. All the files are attached in the repository.

### Limitations and future work
This code is just the beginning of a small program and should be refactored to improve the quality of the code.
